# What is the output of the following code?
# int x = 30
# int[] students = new int[x]
# x = 60
# Console.WriteLine("x is " + x)
# Console.WriteLine("The number of student is " + students.Length)

# I have tried to re-write this code in python
# and  I have also searched but all the results it is giving out are either in c++, c#, or java  languages
# although i've seen the answer which is (the number of students is' 60 and x = 30)
